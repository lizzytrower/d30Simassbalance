# d30Simassbalance
These Matlab codes accompany the manuscript "Precambrian Si isotope mass balance and the significance of the authigenic clay silica sink" by Trower and Fischer. The files were designed on Matlab R2017b on a Windows computer and do not need input to run; they can be called directly from the command line.
